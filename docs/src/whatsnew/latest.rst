📢 Announcements
================

#. N/A


✨ Features
===========

#. `@ESadek-MO` made MeshCoords immutable. :class:`iris.MeshCoord`s are now updated automatically when
   changing the attached mesh. All changes from to the :class:`iris.MeshCoord` should instead be done to
   the relevant :class:`iris.Coord` located on the attached :class:`iris.MeshXY`. This change also affects the behaviour
   when calling :prop:`iris.MeshCoord.points` and :prop:`MeshCoord.bounds`, which will return real data but will leave the
   :class:`iris.MeshCoord` (and attached mesh) lazy. (:issue:`4757`, :pull:`6405`)


🐛 Bugs Fixed
=============

#. `@HGWright`_ added a new warning to inform users that the boolean coordinate generated by
   :meth:`iris.coord_categorisation.add_season_membership` is not saveable to netcdf. (:pull:`6305`)
